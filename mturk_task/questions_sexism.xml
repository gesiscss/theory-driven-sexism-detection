<p><strong>What makes a message sexist?</strong></p>
            <p>Your task is to annotate if a sentence is sexist: because of its content (what the speaker believes), or because of its phrasing (because of the speaker’s choice of words)</p>
            <p>Task 1:</p>
            <p>A message may be sexist because of its content--in other words, because of what the speaker believes. For example, the speaker may express sexist attitudes towards gender inequality, either endorsing it (e.g. “some jobs are best left to men”), or antagonizing it (e.g. “the pay gap between genders does not exist, feminists should stop complaining”). Also, the speaker may express stereotypes (how genders are traditionally seen and compared to each other) and behavioral expectations (how individuals of a gender should behave according to traditional views). Be careful: sexism may also include positive stereotypes (e.g. “women are the best home cooks”), or target  men (e.g., “men should not cry”)!</p>
            <p>Task 2:</p>
            <p>Moreover, a message may be sexist simply because of how the speaker phrases it--independently from what general beliefs or attitudes the speaker holds. A message is sexist, for example, when it contains attacks, foul language, or derogatory depictions directed towards individuals because of their gender, e.g. by means of name-calling ("you bitch"), attacks ("I'm going to kick her back to the kitchen"), objectification ("She's stupid but I'd still do her"), inflammatory messages ("burn all women"). However, just because a message is aggressive or uses offensive language does not mean that it is sexist! </p>

            <p>Disclaimer: This tasks contains language that might be offensive to some turkers (e.g., sexism and swear words). Do not do this task if this is an issue for you.</p>
<p>Ready to help us understand sexism?
