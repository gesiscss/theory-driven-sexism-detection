This repository contains the code for our paper ["“Call me sexist, but...” : Revisiting Sexism Detection Using Psychological Scales and Adversarial Samples"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.12764.pdf). 

The repository comprises of the scripts used to generate the results in the paper. You can download the data from [here](https://doi.org/10.7802/2251) and unzip it in the data folder. 

To run the code:

- go to the code folder
- install requirements from 'requirements.txt'
- To reproduce the machine learning models, run 'classifiy.py'
- To get the tables and figures, run the notebook 'get results.ipynb'


In addition to the code, we also release the files we used for our Amazon Mechanical Turk task in the 'mturk_task' folder.
