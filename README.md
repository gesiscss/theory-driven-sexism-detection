This repository contains the code for our paper ["“Call me sexist, but...” : Revisiting Sexism Detection Using Psychological Scales and Adversarial Samples"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.12764.pdf). 

The repository comprises of the scripts used to generate the results in the paper. You can download the data from [here](https://doi.org/10.7802/2251) and unzip it in the data folder. 

To run the code:

- install requirements from 'requirements.txt'
- go to the code folder
- To get the tables and figures, run the notebook 'plot figures.ipynb'
- To reproduce the machine learning models, run 'check_classification_results.py'

In addition to the code, we also release the files we used for our Amazon Mechanical Turk task in the 'mturk_task' folder. 

If you use the code, please cite the following paper:
